### Description of the Topology
This repository includes code defining the infrastructure below. 

![]https://github.com/aavzta/ELK-Stack/blob/main/Diagram/U13%20ELK.pdf

The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the "D*mn Vulnerable Web Application"

Load balancing ensures that the application will be highly **available**, in addition to restricting **inbound access** to the network. The load balancer ensures that work to process incoming traffic will be shared by both vulnerable web servers. Access controls will ensure that only authorized users — namely, ourselves — will be able to connect in the first place.

Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the **file systems of the VMs on the network**, as well as watch **system metrics**, such as CPU usage; attempted SSH logins; `sudo` escalation failures; etc.

The configuration details of each machine may be found below.

| Name     |   Function  | IP Address | Operating System |
|----------|-------------|------------|------------------|
| Jump Box | Gateway     | 10.0.0.4   | Linux            |
| Web-1    | Web Server  | 10.0.0.5   | Linux            |
| Web-2    | Web Server  | 10.0.0.6   | Linux            |
| ELK      | Monitoring  | 10.1.0.4   | Linux            |

In addition to the above, Azure has provisioned a **load balancer** in front of all machines except for the jump box. The load balancer's targets are organized into the following availability zones:
- **Availability Zone 1**: Web-1 + Web-2

## ELK Server Configuration
The ELK VM exposes an Elastic Stack instance. **Docker** is used to download and manage an ELK container.

Rather than configure ELK manually, we opted to develop a reusable Ansible Playbook to accomplish the task. This playbook is duplicated below.


To use this playbook, one must log into the Jump Box, then issue: `ansible-playbook install_elk.yml elk`. This runs the `install_elk.yml` playbook on the `elk` host.

### Access Policies
The machines on the internal network are _not_ exposed to the public Internet. 

Only the **jump box** machine can accept connections from the Internet. Access to this machine is only allowed from the IP address `180.xxx.xx.xx`

Machines _within_ the network can only be accessed by **each other**. The Web-1 and Web-2 VMs send traffic to the ELK server.

A summary of the access policies in place can be found in the table below.

| Name     | Publicly Accessible (Port) | Allowed IP Addresses |
|----------|----------------------------|----------------------|
| Jump Box | Yes (SSH 22)               | 180.xxx.xx.xx        |
| ELK      | Yes (HTTP 5601)            | 180.xxx.xx.xx        |
| Web-1    | No  (SSH 22)               | 180.xxx.xx.xx        |
| Web-2    | No  (SSH 22)               | 180.xxx.xx.xx        |

### Elk Configuration

Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because:

- App deployment, configuration management, workflow orchestration can be performed quickly, repetitively and at scale. 
- Human readable automation, tasks are executed in order, no special coding skills needed.

### Ansible Playbooks

The following playbooks are used in build & deployment:

#### Install-elk.yml
- install Docker
- install Python3
- install Docker Python module
- increase memory map area (262144)
- download and launch Docker elk container on boot

#### filebeat-playbook.yml
- download and install filebeat.deb
- enable and configure the system module
- setup and start the filebeat service on boot

#### metricbeat-playbook.yml
- download and install metricbeat.deb
- enable and configure the docker module for metricbeat
- setup and start the metricbeat service on boot


The following screenshot displays the result of running `docker ps` after successfully configuring the ELK instance.

The playbook is duplicated below.
```yaml
---
- name: Configure Elk VM with Docker
  hosts: elk
  remote_user: azadmin
  become: true
  tasks:
    # Use apt module
    - name: Install docker.io
      apt:
        update_cache: yes
        name: docker.io
        state: present

      # Use apt module
    - name: Install pip3
      apt:
        force_apt_get: yes
        name: python3-pip
        state: present

      # Use pip module
    - name: Install Docker python module
      pip:
        name: docker
        state: present

      # Use sysctl module
    - name: Use more memory
      sysctl:

        value: "262144"
        state: present
        reload: yes

      # Use docker_container module
    - name: download and launch a docker elk container
      docker_container:

      # Use systemd module
    - name: Enable service docker on boot
      systemd:
        name: docker
        enabled: yes


```

### Target Machines & Beats
This ELK server is configured to monitor the Web-1 and Web-2 VMs, at `10.0.0.5` and `10.0.0.6`, respectively.

We have installed the following Beats on these machines:
- Filebeat
- Metricbeat

These Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:
- **Filebeat**: Filebeat detects changes to the filesystem. Specifically, we use it to collect Apache logs.
- **Metricbeat**: Metricbeat detects changes in system metrics, such as CPU usage. We use it to detect SSH login attempts, failed `sudo` escalations, and CPU/RAM statistics.

```yaml
---
- name: Installing and Launch Filebeat
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    # Use command module
  - name: Download filebeat .deb file
    command: curl -L -O https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/beats/filebeat/filebeat-7.4.0-amd64.deb

    # Use command module
  - name: Install filebeat .deb
    command: dpkg -i filebeat-7.4.0-amd64.deb

    # Use copy module
  - name: Drop in filebeat.yml
    copy:
      src: /etc/ansible/files/filebeat-config.yml
      dest: /etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml

    # Use command module
  - name: Enable and Configure System Module
    command: filebeat modules enable system

    # Use command module
  - name: Setup filebeat
    command: filebeat setup

    # Use command module
  - name: Start filebeat service
    command: service filebeat start

    # Use systemd module
  - name: Enable service filebeat on boot
    systemd:
      name: filebeat
      enabled: yes
```

```yaml
---
- name: Install metric beat
  hosts: webservers
  become: true
  tasks:
    # Use command module
  - name: Download metricbeat
    command: curl -L -O https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/beats/metricbeat/metricbeat-7.4.0-amd64.deb

    # Use command module
  - name: install metricbeat
    command: dpkg -i metricbeat-7.4.0-amd64.deb

    # Use copy module
  - name: drop in metricbeat config
    copy:
      src: /etc/ansible/files/metricbeat-config.yml
      dest: /etc/metricbeat/metricbeat.yml

    # Use command module
  - name: enable and configure docker module for metric beat
    command: metricbeat modules enable docker

    # Use command module
  - name: setup metric beat
    command: metricbeat setup

    # Use command module
  - name: start metric beat
    command: service metricbeat start

    # Use systemd module
  - name: Enable service metricbeat on boot
    systemd:
      name: metricbeat
      enabled: yes
```


### Using the Playbooks
In order to use the playbooks, you will need to have an Ansible control node already configured. We use the **jump box** for this purpose.

To use the playbooks, we must perform the following steps:
- Copy the playbooks to the Ansible Control Node
- Run each playbook on the appropriate targets

The easiest way to copy the playbooks is to use Git:

```bash
$ cd /etc/ansible
$ mkdir files
# Clone Repository + IaC Files
$ git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-1.git
# Move Playbooks and hosts file Into `/etc/ansible`
$ cp project-1/playbooks/* .
$ cp project-1/files/* ./files
```

This copies the playbook files to the correct place.

Next, you must create a `hosts` file to specify which VMs to run each playbook on. Run the commands below:

```bash
$ cd /etc/ansible
$ cat > hosts <<EOF
[webservers]
10.0.0.5
10.0.0.6

[elk]
10.0.0.8
EOF
```

After this, the commands below run the playbook:

 ```bash
 $ cd /etc/ansible
 $ ansible-playbook install_elk.yml elk
 $ ansible-playbook install_filebeat.yml webservers
 $ ansible-playbook install_metricbeat.yml webservers
 ```

To verify success, wait five minutes to give ELK time to start up. 

Then, run: `curl http://10.0.0.8:5601`. This is the address of Kibana. If the installation succeeded, this command should print HTML to the console.
